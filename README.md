## Tech writing examples

[See my tech writing examples](https://github.com/zuluecho9/portfolio/blob/main/tech-writing-examples.md). 

## Content marketing examples

Over the years, I’ve done quite a bit of freelance content marketing work for various tech companies. This work has included blog posts, white papers, case studies, guides, and the like. The goals were generally a) to gather online traffic/leads, and b) to communicate expertise and trustworthiness in the chosen domain.

Examples:

* [Hydrolix log storage](#hydrolix-log-storage)
* [Spire satellite data](#spire-satellite-data)

### Hydrolix log storage

Hydrolix is a streaming data-lake solution designed for log storage and analytics. In 2025, I wrote several blog posts for them aimed at gathering more leads from companies with
high-volume logs. This included a focus on the security-related benefits of advanced log parsing and analytics. This work involved me working side-by-side with marketing team members to arrive at optimal SEO approaches for titles and keywords.

Pieces I wrote for Hydrolix:

* [Unlocking threat-hunting insights from high-volume network logs](https://hydrolix.io/blog/threat-hunting-insights/)
* [Log management: A detailed guide](https://hydrolix.io/blog/log-management-guide/)
* [Best practices for monitoring CDN security](https://hydrolix.io/blog/cdn-security-monitoring-best-practices/)


### Spire satellite data

Spire is a satellite company and a satellite data company. Between 2018 and 2021, I wrote roughly a dozen pieces for them, aimed at demonstrating expertise and thought leadership in several domains, including agriculture applications, maritime management applications, and aviation applications. This work involved a lot of research on my part: learning how satellite data was being used, and might be used, to improve various systems and workflows.

I also helped them overhaul their website and write copy for all major components/sections of their new site (although the site has been overhauled again since I did that work).

Here are a few of the resources I created for Spire:

*​ [White paper: An Ocean of Data: The digital revolution and its ongoing impact on maritime industries](https://spire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/An-Ocean-of-Data-The-digital-Revolution.pdf)
*​ [Case study: TTEK uses Spire to improve their aviation products](https://spire.com/case-study/aviation/powering-the-threat-matrix/)
* [Blog post: As renewable energy grows, so does demand for weather data and analytics](https://spire.com/blog/weather-climate/as-renewable-energy-grows-so-does-demand-for-weather-data-and-analytics)
* [Blog post: Top 5 reasons you should be using specialized agriculture weather forecasts](https://spire.com/blog/weather-climate/top-5-reasons-you-should-be-using-specialized-agriculture-weather-forecasts)


## Coding and scripting experience 

I'm far from a professional coder but I have strong general knowledge of software development and deployment. My best language is Python, but I've documented and written code examples for many languages, application frameworks, and types of APIs (with most of that experience coming from my time at New Relic, due to the full-stack breadth of their offerings). AI/LLM tools have dramatically improved my ability to write scripts/code to solve specific technical challenges. 

As evidence of my skills and comfort with coding, check out a [personal coding project](www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7401999440531705856) of mine, which involves video and computer-vision algorithms.  

## Book projects 

I've authored several commercially successful and critically acclaimed books. These projects are a testament to my ability to oversee large, complex projects through to completion. These experiences also taught me a lot about book publishing (e.g., print-on-demand processes, audiobook and ebook production, book cover and interior design) and promotion. 

These projects include: 

* **Poker books.** I used to play poker for a living, way back in the 2003-2007 time frame. This led to me writing critically acclaimed and highly respected books on poker tells/behavior. My poker books have sold more than 48,000 copies, across all formats. [Read some reviews](https://www.readingpokertells.com/reviews). 
* **Political polarization books.** I wrote a couple books aimed at reducing toxic political polarization. These books have received positive reviews from professionals in the political and polarization spheres, including from several polarization researchers.

## Journalism

My independent investigative journalism has exposed fraud, deceptive social media accounts, and liars and propagandists of various sorts. Notable projects include my exposé of behavior “expert” Chase Hughes (with the [first episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t1DMxmqJOk) getting 149K+ views on YouTube), my research into foreign-origin fake Facebook accounts (featured in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/technology/facebook-fake-accounts.html) and [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/when-a-stranger-takes-your-face-facebooks-failed-crackdown-on-fake-accounts/2018/05/04/d3318838-4f1a-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html)), and my investigation into the anonymous fake-news creator known as True Pundit (mentioned in [Buzzfeed by Craig Silverman](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/revealed-notorious-pro-trump-misinformation-site-true)). I’m currently working on an exposé of a security-related product whose claims of being hard to deceive/cheat I've shown to be egregiously false. [See more examples of my investigative journalism](https://apokerplayer.medium.com/zach-elwoods-investigations-into-deceptive-online-activity-60c3b11c2774). 

Another journalistic endeavor of mine is my [psychology-focused podcast](https://behavior-podcast.com), for which I've interviewed more than 170 people. I've interviewed a wide variety of people, including psychology researchers, law enforcement and legal professionals, philosophers, conflict resolution professionals, militant protesters, and more). As smaller podcasts go, it's fairly successful; typical episodes get between 7-9,000 listens in the first month of release, with some video-intensive episodes getting tens of thousands of views on YouTube. [See a compilation of episodes related to law enforcement and investigative work](https://behavior-podcast.com/reading-behavior-in-criminal-security-and-legal-scenarios). 

For my political polarization-related work, I've had [op-eds published](https://www.american-anger.com/media-press) in large news outlets including The Hill and Newsweek. I've also ghostwritten op-eds for other people that have appeared in major news outlets.
