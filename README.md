## About Me

I'm an experienced technical writer and all-around communicator, skilled at turning complex concepts into clear, engaging stories and at seeing large projects through to completion.

In addition to my main tech writing career in software/tech, I've been:
- An instructional designer
- A content marketer
- A commercial video scriptwriter/producer
- An author/publisher of several popular books
- An independent researcher whose work has been mentioned in *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and more

My wide-ranging experience allows me to take on large, complex communication projects with confidence and versatility.

## Coding knowledge

I'm far from a professional coder but I have strong general knowledge about developing and deploying software. Python is my best language. Check out a [personal coding project](www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7401999440531705856) I'm working on to sharpen my knowledge.
